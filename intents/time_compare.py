The time-compare intent can give the result so that user can easily
compare the data according to the way user want.
Also it supports some operations like cropping based on date range,
slicing(removing rows that do not follow the conditions), group by.
Some of the operations are optional.

            It has the contents of the csv file
        metric: Type-string
            It is the name of the column according to which grouping will be done.
            summary operator is applied on metric. Metric could a column
            containing strings, if we are applying count operator on it.
        dimensions: Type-list of str
            It is the name of column we want.
            'compare batsman A and B according to total_runs',
             dimension is 'batsman'. we group by dimensions.
        all_dimensions: Type-list of str
            It is the list of dimension columns in the initial table
        slices: Type-List of tuples
            Tuple represents the conditon to keep the row.
            (column_name, filter, value)
            column_name - is the value of the column that the
            condition is applied upon.
            filter - Filters enum members, ex. Filters.IN
        time_compare_column: Type-string
            the column name by which we will do comparision.
        date_range1: Type-tuple of start_date and end_date
            first date range for which we have to do comparision
        date_range2: Type-tuple of start_date and end_date
            second date range for which we have to do comparision
        date_format: Type-str

            https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
        summary_operator: Type-summary_operators enum members
            It denotes the summary operator, after grouping by dimensions.
            ex. SummaryOperators.MAX, SummaryOperators.SUM
